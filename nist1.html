<h2>
An Introduction to Information Security
</h2>
<div>
Information – (1) Facts or ideas, which can be represented (encoded) as
various forms of data; (2) Knowledge (e.g., data, instructions) in any
medium or form that can be communicated between system entities.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information Security – The protection of information and information
systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,
modification, or destruction in order to ensure confidentiality, integrity,
and availability.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Confidentiality – Preserving authorized restrictions on information
access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and
proprietary information.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Integrity – Guarding against improper information modification or
destruction and ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity. 
<P>
Data Integrity – The property that data has not been altered in an
unauthorized manner. Data integrity covers data in storage, during
processing, and while in transit. 
<P>
System Integrity – The quality that a
system has when it performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner,
free from unauthorized manipulation of the system, whether intentional or
accidental.
</div>

<div>
Availability – Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of
information. • Security Controls – The management, operational, and
technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for a
system to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the
system and its information.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Laws and regulations do not typically provide detailed instructions for
protecting information. Instead, they specify broad, flexible requirements
such as restricting the availability of personal data to authorized users.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information security supports the mission of the organization ... Private
and public-sector organizations improve both profit and service to
customers when appropriate security protections are in place. Information
security, therefore, is a means to an end and not an end in itself. 

<p>
In an
inter- organizational system, each organization benefits from securing the
system. For example, for electronic commerce to be successful, each of the
participants requires security controls to protect their resources. Good
security on the buyer's system also benefits the seller; the buyer's system
is less likely to be used for fraud, to become unavailable, or to otherwise
negatively affect the seller.
</div>

<div>
Information security is an integral element of sound management...
Management personnel are ultimately responsible for determining the level
of acceptable risk for a specific system and the organization as a whole,
taking into account the cost of security controls. Since information
security risk cannot be completely eliminated, the objective is to find the
optimal balance between protecting the information or system and utilizing
available resources.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information security protections are implemented so as to be commensurate
with risk... Risk to a system can never be completely eliminated.
Therefore, it is crucial to manage risk by striking a balance between
usability and the implementation of security protections. The primary
objective of risk management is to implement security protections that are
commensurate with risk. Applying unnecessary protections may waste
resources and make systems more difficult to use and maintain.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Security benefits have both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include
purchasing, installing, and administering security protections (e.g.,
access control software or fire-suppression systems). Indirect costs may
affect both system and business performance, employee morale, or retraining
requirements. In some cases, indirect costs may exceed the direct cost of
the control.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information security roles and responsibilities are made explicit... The
roles and responsibilities of system owners, common control providers,
authorizing officials, system security officers, users, and others are
clear and documented. If the responsibilities are not made explicit,
management may find it difficult to hold personnel accountable for future
outcomes.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information security responsibilities for system owners go beyond their own
organization... When an interconnection between two or more systems is in
place, information security responsibilities might be shared amongst the
participating organizations. When such is the case, the system owners are
responsible for sharing the security measures used by the organization to
provide confidence to the user that the system is adequately secure and
capable of meeting security requirements.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information security requires a comprehensive and integrated approach....
Defense-in- depth utilizes administrative defenses (e.g., policies,
procedures) and security technologies (e.g., intrusion detection systems,
firewalls, configuration settings, and antivirus software) in tandem with
physical security defenses (e.g., gates, guards) to minimize the
probability of a successful attack on the system. These measures not only
help reduce the likelihood that a security breach will compromise access to
system assets or have detrimental effects on confidentiality, integrity, or
availability, but also give the organization near-real time notification
once an attack has been initiated.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Interdependencies of security controls... Security controls are seldom put
in place as stand-alone solutions to a problem. They are typically more
effective when paired with another control or set of controls. Security
controls, when selected properly, can have a synergistic effect on the
overall security of a system.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Other interdependencies... System managers must be able to recognize how
information security relates to other security disciplines like physical
and environmental security. Understanding how those relationships work
together will prove beneficial when implementing a more holistic security
strategy. Understanding the relationships between security controls is
especially important when systems are connected to other systems or
interconnected to a globally distributed supply chain ecosystem.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information security is assessed and monitored regularly... Information
security is not a static process and requires continuous monitoring and
management to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information as well as to ensure that new vulnerabilities and evolving
threats are quickly identified and responded to accordingly.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information security is constrained by societal and cultural factors... An
organization’s own culture can impact its response to information security.
Careful explanation of the risks associated with the business practices can
help in the transparency and acceptance of the recommended information
security practices. It is incumbent on organizations to find a balance
between information security requirements and usability. Organizations can
leverage a variety of tools that meet the security requirements of their
system(s) without unduly burdening the user. Providing updated and
recurring training on what is and what is not an acceptable use of
organizational systems helps safeguard the overall security of the system.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>

<div>
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Responsibilities include, but
are not limited to: • Managing and implementing an organization-wide
information security program; and • Assuming the role of authorizing
official designated representative or security control assessor when
needed.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
The System Owner is an organizational official responsible for the
procurement, development, integration, modification, operation,
maintenance, and disposal of a system.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
The System Security Officer is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate
operational security posture is maintained for a system and as such, works
in close collaboration with the system owner.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
The Information Security Architect is an individual, group, or organization
responsible for ensuring that the information security requirements
necessary to protect the organization’s core missions and business

</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>

appropriate physical security controls, often in consultation with
information security management, program and functional managers.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Privacy Office Staff. This office is responsible for maintaining a
comprehensive privacy program that ensures compliance with applicable
privacy requirements, develops and evaluates privacy policy, and manages
privacy risks.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
A vulnerability is a weakness in a system, system security procedure,
internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat
source... A threat source can be adversarial or non-adversarial.
Adversarial threat sources are individuals, groups, organizations, or
entities that seek to exploit an organization’s dependence on cyber
resources.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Non-adversarial threat sources refer to natural disasters or erroneous
actions taken by individuals in the course of executing their everyday
responsibilities. If the system is vulnerable, threat sources can lead to
threat events. A threat event is an incident or situation that could
potentially cause undesirable consequences or impacts.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
In order to protect a system from risk and to implement the most
cost-effective security measures, system owners, managers, and users need
to know and understand the vulnerabilities of the system as well as the
threat sources and events that may exploit the vulnerabilities.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Social media accounts provide a means of gathering contact information,
interests, and personal connections of a targeted individual which in turn
can be used to conduct a social engineering attack.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Social engineering, in the context of information security, is a technique
that relies heavily on human interaction to influence an individual to
violate security protocol and encourages the individual to divulge
confidential information.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
An advanced persistent threat is a long-term intrusion that attempts to
gain access to specific data and information. Instead of trying to cause
damage, APT attacks are designed to harvest information from the network or
target.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Employees can represent an insider threat to an organization given their
familiarity with the employer’s systems and applications as well as what
actions may cause the most damage, mischief, or disorder. Employee
sabotage—often instigated by knowledge or threat of termination—is a
critical issue for organizations and their systems.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Malicious hacker is a term used to describe an individual or group who use
an understanding of systems, networking, and programming to illegally
access systems, cause damage, or steal information.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Malicious code refers to viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and
any other software created for the purpose of attacking a platform.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Errors and omissions can be inadvertently caused by system operators who
process hundreds of transactions daily or by users who create and edit data
on organizational systems. These errors and omissions can degrade data and
system integrity.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information security policy is defined as an aggregate of directives,
regulations, rules, and practices that prescribes how an organization
manages, protects, and distributes information. Because policy is written
at a broad level, organizations also develop standards, guidelines, and
procedures that offer users, managers, system administrators, and others a
clearer approach to implementing policy and meeting organizational goals.
Standards and guidelines specify technologies and methodologies to be used
to secure systems. Procedures are yet more detailed steps to be followed to
accomplish security-related tasks.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Organizational standards specify uniform use of specific technologies,
parameters, or procedures when such uniform use will benefit an
organization. Standards are normally compulsory within an organization.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Guidelines assist users, systems personnel, and others in effectively
securing their systems. Guidelines are often used to help ensure that
specific security measures are not overlooked, although they can be
implemented, and correctly so, in more than one way.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Procedures describe how to implement applicable security policies,
standards, and guidelines. They are detailed steps to be followed by users,
system operations personnel, or others to accomplish a particular task.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Program policy is used to create an organization’s information security
program. Program policies set the strategic direction for security and
assign resources for its implementation within the organization.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Program policy addresses the following: Purpose. Program policy often
includes a statement describing the purpose and goals of the program.
Security-related needs such as integrity, availability, and confidentiality
can form the basis of organizational goals established in the policy.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Scope. Program policies are clear as to which resources (e.g., facilities,
hardware and software, information, and personnel) the information security
program protects.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Responsibilities. The responsibilities of officials and offices throughout
the organization also need to be addressed. It can also serve as the basis
for establishing employee accountability.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Issue-Specific Policy... The intent is to provide specific guidance and
instructions on proper usage of systems to employees within the
organization. An issue-specific policy is meant for every technology the
organization uses and is written in such a way that it will be clear to
users.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
System-specific policies provide information and direction on what actions
are permitted on a particular system. These policies are similar to
issue-specific policies in that they relate to specific technologies
throughout the organization. However, system-specific policies dictate the
appropriate security configurations to the personnel responsible for
implementing the required security controls in order to meet the
organization’s information security needs.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Risk is a measure of the extent an entity is threatened by a potential
circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts
that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the
likelihood of occurrence.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Risk management requires organizations to (i) frame risk, (ii) assess risk,
(iii) respond to risk, and (iv) monitor risk. Framing Risk – describes how
organizations establish a risk context for the environment in which
risk-based decisions are made. Assessing Risk – describes how organizations
analyze risk within the context of the organizational risk frame.
Responding to Risk – addresses how organizations respond to risk once that
risk is determined based on the results of risk assessments. Monitoring
Risk – addresses how organizations monitor risk over time.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Risk Management Framework (RMF). The six steps that comprise the RMF
include: 1. System Categorization; 2. Security Control Selection; 3.
Security Control Implementation; 4. Security Control Assessment; 5. System
Authorization; and 6. Security Control Monitoring
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
The first step of the RMF focuses on the categorization of the system.
Here, organizations categorize the system and the information processed,
stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
The second step of the RMF process involves selecting an initial set of
baseline security controls for the system based on the security
categorization as well as tailoring and supplementing the security control
baseline as needed based on an organizational assessment of risk and local
conditions.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
In the third step, the organization is responsible for implementing
security controls and describing how the controls are employed within the
system and its environment of operation.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
The fourth step ensures that the organization assesses the security
controls using appropriate assessment procedures and to determine the
extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the system.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
In the fifth step, a senior manager officially authorizes a system to
operate or continue to operate based on the results of a complete and
thorough security control assessment.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
The sixth step of the RMF is to continuously monitor the security controls
in the system to ensure that they are effective over time as changes occur
in the system and the environment in which the system operates.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Information assurance is the degree of confidence one has that security
measures protect and defend information and systems by ensuring their
availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and
non-repudiation.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Authorization is the official management decision to authorize the
operation of a system. The authorizing official (a senior organizational
executive) explicitly accepts the risk of operating the system.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
To facilitate sound risk-based decision making, decisions are based on
reliable and current information about the implementation and effectiveness
of both technical and nontechnical safeguards. These include: • Technical
features (Do they operate as intended?); • Operational policies and
practices (Is the system operated according to stated policies and
practices?); • Overall security (Are there threats that the safeguards do
not address?); and • Remaining risk (Is residual risk at an acceptable
level?)
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
One factor in reliable security is the concept of ease of safe use, which
postulates that a system that is easier to secure is more likely to
actually be secure. Security features may be more likely utilized when the
initial system defaults to the "most secure" option.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Security tends to degrade during the operational phase of the system life
cycle. System users and operators discover new ways to intentionally or
unintentionally bypass or subvert security, especially if there is a
perception that bypassing security improves functionality or that there
will be no repercussions to them or their systems.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Organizations use three basic methods to maintain operational assurance: •
System assessment. An event or a continuous process to evaluate security.
An assessment can vary widely in scope: it may examine an entire system for
the purpose of authorization or it may investigate a single anomalous
event; • System audit. An independent review and examination of records and
activities to assess the adequacy of system controls and to ensure
compliance with established policies and operational procedures; and •
System monitoring. A process for maintaining ongoing awareness of
information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support
organizational risk management decisions.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Assessments can address the quality of the system as built, implemented, or
operated. Assessments can be performed throughout the development cycle,
after system installation, and throughout its operational phase. Assessment
methods include interviews, examinations, and testing. Some common testing
techniques feature functional testing (to see if a given function works
according to its requirements) or penetration testing (to see if security
can be bypassed). These techniques can range from trying several test cases
to in-depth studies using metrics, automated tools, or multiple detailed
test cases.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
An audit conducted to support operational assurance examines whether the
system is meeting stated or implied security requirements as well as system
and organization policies. Some audits also examine whether security
requirements are appropriate, though this is outside of the scope of
operational assurance.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
There are two types of automated tools: (1) active tools, which find
vulnerabilities by trying to exploit them; and (2) passive tests, which
only examine the system and infer the existence of problems from the state
of the system.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Automated tools can be used to help uncover a variety of threats and
vulnerabilities, such as improper access controls or access control
configurations, weak passwords, lack of system software integrity, or not
applying all relevant software updates and patches.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Baselines are the starting point of the security control selection process
for systems. Once a security control baseline is selected, organizations
use the tailoring guidance in NIST SP 800-53 to remove controls from the
baseline (with a justification based on risk) or to add compensating or
supplemental controls to strengthen the security posture of a specific
system. Care needs to be taken to ensure that deviations from the baseline
are based on an assessment of the associated risk as the changes may be
appropriate for the system's particular environment or technical
constraints.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Configuration management provides assurance that the system in operation
has been configured to organizational needs and standards, that any changes
to be made are reviewed for security implications, and that such changes
have been approved by management prior to implementation. Configuration
management can be used to help ensure that changes take place in an
identifiable and controlled environment and that they do not
unintentionally harm any of the system's properties, including its
security.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
In addition to monitoring the system, it is useful to monitor external
sources for information. Such sources as trade literature, both printed and
electronic, have information about security vulnerabilities, patches, and
other areas that impact security.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Support and operations are routine activities that enable systems to
function correctly. These include fixing software or hardware problems,
installing and maintaining software, and helping users resolve problems.
The failure to consider security as part of the support and operations of
systems, can be detrimental to the organization.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Access is the ability to make use of any system resource. Access control is
the process of granting or denying specific requests to: 1) obtain and use
information and related information processing services; and 2) enter
specific physical facilities.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
System-based access controls are called logical access controls. Logical
access controls can prescribe not only who or what (in the case of a
process) is to have access to a specific system resource, but also the type
of access that is permitted. Examples of access control security controls
include: account management, separation of duties, least privilege, session
lock, information flow enforcement, and session termination.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Making system users aware of their security responsibilities and teaching
them correct practices helps change their behavior. It also supports
individual accountability, which is one of the most important ways to
improve information security. Without knowing the necessary security
measures or how to use them, users cannot be truly accountable for their
actions. Examples of awareness and training security controls include:
security awareness training, role- based security training, and security
training records.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
An audit is an independent review and examination of records and activities
to assess the adequacy of system controls and ensure compliance with
established policies and operational procedures. An audit trail is a record
of individuals who have accessed a system as well as what operations the
user has performed during a given period. Examples of audit and
accountability controls include: audit events, time stamps, non-
repudiation, protection of audit information, audit record retention, and
session audit.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
A security control assessment is the testing and/or evaluation of the
management, operational, and technical security controls on a system to
determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
meeting the security requirements for the system. Examples of security
assessment and authorization controls include: security assessments, system
interconnections, plans of action and milestones, and continuous
monitoring.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Configuration management consists of determining and documenting the
appropriate specific settings for a system, conducting security impact
analyses, and managing changes through a change control board. It allows
the entire system to be reviewed to help ensure that a change made on one
system does not have adverse effects on another system.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration
checklists) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks
that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology
platforms and products. Examples of configuration management controls
include: baseline configuration, configuration change control, security
impact analysis, least functionality, and software usage restrictions.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
An information security contingency is an event with the potential to
disrupt system operations.... To avert potential contingencies and
disasters or minimize the damage they cause, organizations can take early
steps to control the outcome of the event. Generally, this activity is
called contingency planning. Examples of contingency planning controls
include: contingency plan, contingency training, contingency plan testing,
system backup, and system recovery and reconstitution.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Identification and authentication is a critical building block of
information security since it is the basis for most types of access control
and for establishing user accountability. Access control often requires
that the system be able to identify and differentiate between users.
Examples of identification and authentication controls include: device
identification and authentication, identifier management, authenticator
management, authenticator feedback, and re-authentication.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Risk assessments inform decision makers and support risk responses by
identifying: (i) relevant threats to organizations or threats directed
through organizations against other organizations; (ii) vulnerabilities
both internal and external to organizations; (iii) impact (i.e., harm) to
organizations that may occur given the potential for threats exploiting
vulnerabilities; and (iv) the likelihood that harm will occur. Examples of
risk assessment controls include: security categorization, risk assessment,
vulnerability scanning, and technical surveillance countermeasures survey.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Organizations can better safeguard their information by separating user
functionality and system management functionality. System and
communications protection also establishes boundaries that restrict access
to publicly-accessible information within a system. Using boundary
protections, an organization can monitor and control communications at
external boundaries as well as key internal boundaries within the system.
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
Integrity is defined as guarding against improper information modification
or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and
authenticity. System and information integrity provides assurance that the
information being accessed has not been meddled with or damaged by an error
in the system.
