    <h2>Computer Security, Dieter Gollmann</h2>
</p>


<p>
     <strong><mark>Computer security</strong></mark> can trace its origins back to the 1960s. Multi-user
    systems emerged, needing mechanisms for protecting the system from its
    users, and the users from each other. Protection rings are a concept dating
    from this period.
</p>
<p>
    A new technology becomes a real issue for computer security only when it is
    sufficiently mature and deployed widely enough for new applications with
    new security problems to materialize. With this consideration in mind, we
    observe that computer security has passed through the following epochs:
    1970s: age of the mainframe; 1980s: age of the PC; 1990s: age of the
    Internet; 2000s: age of the web.
</p>
<p>
    The 1990s: this decade became without a doubt the epoch of the Internet.
    Not because the Internet was created in the 1990s – it is much older – but
    because new technology became available and because the Internet was opened
    to commercial use in 1992. The HTTP protocol and HTML provided the basis
    for visually more interesting applications than email or remote procedure
    calls. The World Wide Web (1991) and graphical web browsers (Mosaic, 1993)
    created a whole new ‘user experience’. Both developments facilitated a
    whole new range of applications.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Communications security</strong></mark>
    , however, only solves the easy problem, i.e. protecting data in transit.
    It should have been clear from the start that the real problems resided
    elsewhere. The typical end system was a PC, no longer stand-alone or
    connected to a LAN, but connected to the Internet. Connecting a machine to
    the Internet has two major ramifications. The system owner no longer
    controls who can send inputs to this machine; the system owner no longer
    controls what input is sent to the machine.
</p>
<p>
    The application-level software implementing the services offered on the web
    has become a main target for attacks. Major attack patterns are SQL
    injection, cross-site scripting, and attacks against the domain name
    system. Application software accounts for an increasing number of reported
    vulnerabilities and real attacks.
</p>
<p>
    Proponents of new technologies are often asked to take a precautionary
    approach, study the impact of their technology and develop appropriate
    security mechanisms in advance. This approach can work if the use of the
    technology follows expectations, but is likely to fail in the face of user
    innovations.
</p>
<h2>
    Managing Security
</h2>
<p>
    Keeping the enemy outside the castle walls is a traditional paradigm in
    computer security. However, statistics on the sources of attacks often show
    that attacks from insiders account for a majority of incidents and the
    largest proportion of damage. There is a suggestion that attacks via the
    Internet might change this picture, but <strong><mark>insider fraud</strong></mark>
    remains a considerable concern in organizations and in electronic commerce
    transactions.
</p>
<p>
    It is strongly recommended to organize security responsibilities in an
    organization in a way that makes it clear that security measures have the
    full support of senior management. A brief policy document signed by the
    chief executive that lays down the ground rules can serve as a starting
    point.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Security-awareness</strong></mark>
    programmes convey this information. The converse of users ignoring
    apparently unreasonable security rules are security experts treating
    apparently unreasonable users as the enemy. Trying to force users to follow
    rules they regard as arbitrary is not an efficient approach. Involving
    users as stakeholders in the security of their organization is a better way
    of persuading them to voluntarily comply with rules rather than to look for
    workarounds.
</p>
<p>
Security policies are a core concept in computer security. A    <strong><mark>security policy</strong></mark> is a statement that defines the security
    objectives of an organization; it has to state what needs to be protected;
    it may also indicate how this is to be done. There is considerable variety
    in the target of policies and the level of detail they are expressed in.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Security policy objective</strong></mark>
    : A statement of intent to protect an identified resource from unauthorized
    use. A policy also has to explain how the objectives are to be met. This
    can be done first at the level of the organization.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Organizational security policy</strong></mark>
    : The set of laws, rules, and practices that regulate how an organization
    manages, protects, and distributes resources to achieve specified security
    policy objectives.
</p>
<p>
    Within an IT system, <strong><mark>organizational policies</strong></mark> can be
    supported by technical means. Automated security policy: The set of
    restrictions and properties that specify how a computing system prevents
    information and computing resources from being used to violate an
    organizational security policy. Automated policies define access control
    lists and firewall settings, stipulate the services that may be run on user
    devices and prescribe the security protocols for protecting network
    traffic.
</p>
<p>
    In security engineering, we would love to <strong><mark>measure security</strong></mark>
    . First, values for various security-relevant factors are obtained. In SANS
    obtaining a value for such a factor is a security measurement. Some values
    can be established objectively, e.g. the number of open network ports,
    whether the latest patch has been installed for a software product or the
    privilege level under which a service program is running.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, a set of measurements may be consolidated into a single value
    that is used for comparing the current security state against a baseline or
    a past state. In SANS terminology, the values used by management for making
    security comparisons are called <strong><mark>security metrics</strong></mark>.
</p>
<p>
    Measurements of a product are indicative of its potential security, but
    even a secure product can be deployed in an insecure manner. It is thus a
    task for security management to ensure that the security features provided
    are properly used.
</p>
<p>
    How relevant is the number of security flaws? It is sufficient for an
    attacker to find and exploit a single flaw to compromise security. It is
    equally open to debate whether such metrics could be the basis for a
    meaningful security comparison of products, given that it is rare to find
    two products that serve exactly the same purpose.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, desirable as security metrics are, we have at best metrics for
    some individual aspects of security. The search for better metrics is still
    an open field of research.
</p>
<h2>
    Risk and Threat Analysis
</h2>
<p>
Without a structured and systematic approach to    <strong><mark>risk analysis</strong></mark>, you are in danger of getting lost in the
    details of particular security problems but failing to establish a
    comprehensive overview of your risks.
</p>
<p>
    Informally, <strong><mark>risk</strong></mark> is the possibility that some incident or
    attack can cause damage to your enterprise. An attack against an IT system
    consists of a sequence of actions, exploiting vulnerabilities in the system
    until the attacker’s goals have been achieved. To assess the risk posed by
    the attack you have to evaluate the impact of the attack and the likelihood
    of the attack occurring.
</p>
<p>
    A <strong><mark>threat</strong></mark> is an undesirable negative impact on your assets.
    There are various ways of identifying threats. You can categorize threats
    by their impact on assets and agents. For example, Microsoft’s STRIDE
    threat model for software security lists the following categories:
</p>
<p><ul>
    · Spoofing identities – an agent pretends to be somebody else;
</p>
<p>
    · Tampering with data – violates the integrity of an asset;
</p>
<p>
    · Repudiation – an agent denies having performed an action;
</p>
<p>
    · Information disclosure – violates the confidentiality of an asset;
</p>
<p>
    · Denial of service – violates the availability of an asset;
</p>
<p>
    · Elevation of privilege – an agent gains more privileges beyond its
    entitlement.
</p></ul>
<p>
    Once you move to the implementation stage, you have to examine your system
    for vulnerabilities. <strong><mark>Vulnerabilities</strong></mark> are weaknesses of a
    system that could be accidentally or intentionally exploited to damage
    assets. In an IT system, typical vulnerabilities are: accounts with system
    privileges with default passwords programs with unnecessary privileges;
    programs with known flaws; weak access control settings on resources, weak
    firewall configurations
</p>
<p>
    Vulnerability scanners provide a systematic and automated way of
    identifying vulnerabilities. Their knowledge base of known vulnerabilities
    has to be kept up to date.
</p>
<p>
    A threat materializes when an attack succeeds. An attack is a sequence of
    steps. It may start innocuously, gathering information needed to move on to
    gain privileges on one machine, from there jump to another machine, until
    the final target is reached. To get a fuller picture of its potential
    impact, a forest of <strong><mark>attack trees</strong></mark> can be constructed.
</p>
<p>
    The severity of an attack depends on the likelihood that it will be
    launched, the likelihood that it will succeed, and the damage that it might
    do. Likelihood depends on the difficulty of the attack, on the motivation
    of the attacker, on the number of potential attackers, and on existing
    countermeasures.
</p>
<p>
    Having measured the value of assets, the criticality of vulnerabilities,
    and the likelihood and impact of threats, you now face the tricky task of
    calculating your risks. Very informally, you can calculate risk as: Risk =
    Assets x Threats x Vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
    The result of a <strong><mark>risk analysis</strong></mark> is a prioritized list of
    threats, together with recommended countermeasures to mitigate risk. Risk
    analysis tools usually come with a knowledge base of countermeasures for
    the threats they can identify. Risk analysis is also used for calculating
    the return on security investment (ROSI). ROSI compares for given security
    measures the expected reduction in risk with the costs of fielding the
    security measures.
</p>
<h2>
    Foundations of Computer Security
</h2>
<p>
    Accidental failures count as reliability issues, operating mistakes as
usability issues. Security is concerned with    <strong><mark>intentional failures</strong></mark>. There may not always be a clear
    intent to achieve a particular goal, but there is at some stage a decision
    by a person to do something that person is not supposed to do. The root
    cause of security problems is thus human nature.
</p>
<p>
    Security is about the protection of assets. This definition implies that
you have to know your assets and their value. A rough classification of    <strong><mark>protection measures</strong></mark> distinguishes between the following:
</p>
<p><ul>
    · prevention – taking measures that prevent your assets from being damaged;
</p>
<p>
    · detection – taking measures that allow you to detect when an asset has
    been damaged, how it has been damaged, and who has caused the damage;
</p>
<p>
    · reaction – taking measures that allow you to recover your assets or to
    recover from damage to your assets.
</p></ul>
<p>
    In a first attempt to capture the notion of computer security, we examine
    how information assets can be compromised. The definition most frequently
    proposed covers three aspects: <strong><mark>confidentiality</strong></mark> –
prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information;    <strong><mark>integrity</strong></mark> – prevention of unauthorized modification of
    information; <strong><mark>availability</strong></mark> – prevention of unauthorized
    withholding of information or resources.
</p>
<p>
    Once you delve deeper into confidentiality issues you will face the
    question of whether you only want to hide the content of a document from
    unauthorized view, or also its existence.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to hide who is engaging in a given action, you could ask for a
    property such as anonymity. Anonymity – A subject (user) is anonymous if it
    cannot be identified within a given anonymity set of subjects.
</p>
<p>
    The Orange Book definition of <strong><mark>data integrity</strong></mark>: The state
    that exists when computerized data is the same as that in the source
    documents and has not been exposed to accidental or malicious alteration or
    destruction.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Integrity</strong></mark>
    is often a prerequisite for other security properties. For example, an
    attacker could try to circumvent confidentiality controls by modifying the
    operating system or an access control table referenced by the operating
    system. Hence, we have to protect the integrity of the operating system or
    the integrity of access control data structures to achieve confidentiality.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Availability</strong></mark>
    is very much a concern beyond the traditional boundaries of computer
    security. Engineering techniques used to improve availability often come
    from other areas such as fault-tolerant computing. In the context of
    security, we want to ensure that a malicious attacker cannot prevent
    legitimate users from having reasonable access to their systems. That is,
    we want to prevent denial of service.
</p>
<p>
    We may find a flaw in our security system that allows an attacker to find a
    way past our controls. Therefore, we may add a new security requirement to
    our list. Users should be held responsible for their actions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Accountability</strong></mark>
    – Audit information must be selectively kept and protected so that actions
    affecting security can be traced to the responsible party. To be able to do
    so, the system has to identify and authenticate users. It has to keep an
    audit trail of security-relevant events.
</p>
<p>
Non-repudiation is related to accountability.    <strong><mark>Non-repudiation</strong></mark> services provide unforgeable evidence that
    a specific action occurred. This definition is meaningful when analyzing
    the security services cryptographic mechanisms can provide. Digital
    signatures provide non-repudiation. Typical non-repudiation services in
    communications security are nonrepudiation of origin providing evidence
    about the sender of a document, and non-repudiation of delivery, providing
    evidence that a message was delivered to a specific recipient.
</p>
<p>
    A discussion of security has several reasons for mentioning other areas of
    computing such as reliability, relating to (accidental) failures, and
    safety, relating to the impact of system failures on their environment,
    which also deal with situations where a system has to perform properly in
    adverse conditions.
</p>
<p>
    Computer security deals with the prevention and detection of unauthorized
    actions by users of a computer system. With this definition, proper
authorization and access control are essential to computer security.    <strong><mark>Proper authorization</strong></mark> assumes the existence of a security
    policy... The definition above describes what we do in computer security.
    When looking at the root causes for why we do it, we might adopt a
    definition such as: Computer security is concerned with the measures we can
    take to deal with intentional actions by parties behaving in some unwelcome
    fashion.
</p>
<p>
    Computer security is about controlling access to information and resources.
    However, controlling access to information can sometimes be elusive and is
    therefore often replaced by the more straightforward goal of controlling
    access to data. The distinction between data and information is subtle but
    it is also the root of some of the more difficult problems in security.
    Data represents information. Information is the (subjective) interpretation
    of data.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>First Design Decision</strong></mark>
    : In a given application, should the protection mechanisms in a computer
    system focus on data, operations, or users? It is a fundamental design
    decision choosing which of these options to take when applying security
    controls. Operating systems have traditionally focused on protecting data
    (resources). In modern applications, it is often more relevant to control
    the users’ actions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Second Design Decision</strong></mark>
    : In which layer of the computer system should a security mechanism be
    placed? When you investigate fielded security products, you will observe
    security mechanisms at every layer of this model, from hardware to
    application software. It is the task of the designer to find the right
    layer for each mechanism and to find the right mechanisms for each layer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Third Design Decision</strong></mark>
    : Do you prefer simplicity – and higher assurance – to a feature-rich
    security environment? To achieve a high degree of assurance, the security
    system has to be examined in close detail and as exhaustively as possible.
    Hence, there is a trade-off between complexity and assurance. The higher an
    assurance level you aim for, the simpler your system ought to be.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Fourth Design Decision</strong></mark>
    : Should the tasks of defining and enforcing security be given to a central
    entity or should they be left to individual components in a system? This
    question arises naturally in distributed systems security and you will see
    examples of both alternatives. Every protection mechanism defines a
    security perimeter (boundary). The parts of the system that can malfunction
    without compromising the protection mechanism lie outside this perimeter.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Fifth Design Decision</strong></mark>
    : How can you prevent an attacker from getting access to a layer below the
    protection mechanism? An attacker with access to the ‘layer below’ is in a
    position to subvert protection mechanisms further up. The fact that
    security mechanisms have a soft underbelly and are vulnerable to attacks
    from lower layers should be a reason for concern, but not for despair. When
    you reach the stage where you cannot apply computer security mechanisms or
    do not want to do so, you still can put in place physical or organizational
    security measures.
</p>
<h2>
    Identification and Authentication
</h2>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Abstraction</strong></mark>
    is useful and dangerous at the same time. It is useful to discuss password
    security in abstract terms. You can examine policies on password formats or
    aging without knowing how passwords are processed in your IT system. It is
    dangerous to discuss password security only at such an abstract level.
    Implementation flaws can compromise the best security policies.
</p>
<p>
System designers have to balance convenience and security.    <strong><mark>Ease of use</strong></mark> is an important factor in making IT systems
    really useful. Unfortunately, many practices which are convenient also
    introduce new vulnerabilities. This is not the last time the curse of
    convenience will haunt you.
</p>
<h2>
    Access Control
</h2>
<p>
    The very nature of access suggests that there is an active entity, a
    subject or principal, accessing a passive object with some specific access
operation, while a reference monitor grants or denies access.    <strong><mark>Access control</strong></mark> then consists of two steps, authentication,
    and authorization.
</p>
<p>
    Definition. A <strong><mark>principal</strong></mark> is an entity that can be granted
    access to objects or can make statements affecting access control
    decisions. A <strong><mark>subject</strong></mark> is an active entity within an IT
    system. For the purpose of access decisions, subjects have to be bound to
    principals. When a subject requests access to a protected object the
    reference monitor checks whether the principal bound to the subject has the
    right to access the object. We might thus say that the subject ‘speaks for’
    a principal.
</p>
<p>
    Principals and objects present two options for focusing control. You can
    either specify • what a principal is allowed to do, or • what may be done
    with an object.
</p>
<p>
    On the most elementary level, a subject may observe an object or alter an
    object. There are thus two access modes: • Observe – look at the contents
    of an object; • Alter – change the contents of an object.
</p>
<p>
There are two fundamental options for implementing an    <strong><mark>access control matrix</strong></mark>. Access rights can be kept with the
    subjects or with the objects. In the first case, every subject is given a
    capability, an unforgeable token that specifies this subject’s access
    rights. Typically, capabilities are associated with discretionary access
    control.
</p>
<p>
    An <strong><mark>access control list</strong></mark> stores the access rights to an
    object as a list with the object itself. An ACL, therefore, corresponds to
    a column of the access control matrix and states who may access a given
    object. The entries in an ACL are called access control entries (ACEs).
</p>
<p>
    Management of access rights based only on individual subjects can be rather
    cumbersome. It is therefore common practice to place users in groups and to
    derive access rights also from a user’s group.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Roles</strong></mark>
    : a role is a collection of procedures. Roles are assigned to users. A user
    assigned to a role can execute the procedures defined for that role. A user
    can have more than one role and more than one user can have the same role.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Procedures</strong></mark>
    : procedures are ‘high-level’ access control methods with a more complex
    semantic than read or write. Procedures can only be applied to objects of
    certain data types.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Data types</strong></mark>
    : each object is of a certain data type and can be accessed only through
    the procedures defined for this data type. Controlling access to an object
    by restricting the procedures that may access this object is a general
    programming practice.
</p>
<h2>
    Network Security
</h2>
<p>
    To control what traffic is allowed to enter your network (ingress
    filtering) or leave your network (egress filtering) you may deploy a
    firewall. A <strong><mark>firewall</strong></mark> is a network security device
    controlling traffic flow between two parts of a network. Firewalls are
    often installed between the network of an entire organization and the
    Internet, but could also be installed in an intranet to protect individual
    departments.
</p>
<p>
    Firewalls defend a protected network against parties who try to access
    services from outside the network that are intended to be available only
    internally. Firewalls can also restrict access from inside to external
    services that are deemed dangerous or unnecessary for the work of an
    organization.
</p>
<p>
    A firewall can also perform <strong><mark>network address translation</strong></mark>,
    hiding internal machines with private addresses behind public IP addresses,
    and translating public addresses to private addresses for internal servers.
    Hiding the internal structure of a network reduces the attack surface.
    Fewer targets are known to the attacker.

    <strong><mark>Protocol tunneling</strong></mark>
    , i.e. sending data for one protocol through another protocol, negates the
    purpose of a firewall. As more and more careful administrators block almost
    all ports but have to leave port 80 open, more and more protocols are
    tunneled through HTTP to get through the firewall. Another candidate for
    tunneling is the SSH protocol.
</p>
<p>
    Encrypted traffic cannot be examined and filtered, so protocols such as
    HTTPS and SSH that provide end-to-end cryptographic protection cannot be
    monitored by the firewall.
</p>
<p>
    An <strong><mark>intrusion detection system</strong></mark> (IDS) consists of a set of
    sensors gathering data, either located on the hosts or on the network. The
    sensor network is managed from a central console. There, data are analyzed,
    intrusions reported, and possible reactions triggered. There are two
    approaches for detecting intrusions, misuse detection, and anomaly
    detection.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><mark>Vulnerability assessment</strong></mark>
    examines the security state of a network. Information about open ports,
    software packages running (which version, patched?), network topology, etc.
    is collected, and a prioritized list of vulnerabilities is compiled.
    Vulnerability assessment is only as good as the knowledge base being used,
    which has to be updated constantly to handle new threats.
